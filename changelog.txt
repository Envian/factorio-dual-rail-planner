  Features:
    - Adds a toolbar button to enable dual rail planner.
    - Utilizes the standard rail planner, and builds the opposite rail in real time.
    - Supports two way rails with a 2 tile gap.
    - Rail planner will self-cancel when it can't make an opposite rail.
  Known Issues:
    - The secondary rail for elevated rails will not receive supports.
    - The left turn algorithm is incomplete. There are some patterns of left turns
      where the algorithm gives up, but have easy solutions.
    - Some bugs exist which cause issues when transitioning between rail layers.
