Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2025-01-19
  Features:
    - Adds a toolbar button to enable dual rail planner.
    - Utilizes the standard rail planner, and builds the opposite track in real time.
    - Supports two way rails with a 2 tile gap.
  Known Issues:
    - Poor support for elevated rails. Will likely experience unexpected behavior,
      especially with tracks that run along existing supports.
    - The left turn algorithm is incomplete. There are some patterns of left turns
      where the algorithm gives up, but have easy solutions.
