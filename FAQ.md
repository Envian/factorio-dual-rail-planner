## Will this work for modded rails?
Not out of the box. Support will need to be manually added for now, however
better mod support is planned.

## Why don't the diagonals line up with my blueprint?
Diagonal rail spacing isn't as clear and straight forward as grid aligned paths.
There are several ways to approach diagonal rail spacing, and I simply picked
one which I find appealing.

## I Found a bug/edge case/unexpected behavior!
Please post on the
[https://github.com/Envian/factorio-dual-rail-planner/issues](Github Issues) page
and I'll take a look. If you can provide steps to reproduce the problem, please
include them. Otherwise, please include a blueprint string of the path you just
created.

## Can you add support for [SomeFeature]?
Maybe. Feel free to request it on the
[https://github.com/Envian/factorio-dual-rail-planner/issues](Github Issues)
page.
